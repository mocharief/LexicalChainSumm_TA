NEW YORK City (Reuter) - A gunman killed one person and wounded seven others on the crowded 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building Sunday before turning the pistol on himself, police said. The dead person was the intended target and the gunman was in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital, according to police. No further information about the victims and their relationship to the gunman was released. The shooting occurred about 5 p.m. EST and sent hundreds of tourists on the 86th floor of the skyscraper scattering for safety. Witnesses said they dived to the floor as bursts of fire rang out. A St. Vincent's Hospital spokesman said three people wounded in the shootings were being treated there. He said two of them were French nationals, and that they were in serious condition. The hospital spokesman also said witnesses to the incident were being treated for emotional trauma.
